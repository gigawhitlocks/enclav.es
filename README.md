###Want to help out?
1. Check out the repository.
3. Install Vagrant (vagrantup.com) if you do not have it
4. ```vagrant up``` (this will take awhile)
5. ```vagrant ssh``` to log into the VM
6. ```python ~/cluster/cluster.py``` to start the server on port 1337, forwarded to localhost:1337 on host OS

When you're done, run ```vagrant suspend``` to pause the VM, and ```vagrant resume``` to restart it.
